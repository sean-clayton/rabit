{{!--

  Settings file for the rabit theme handlebars files. The settings for styling is in assets/sass/_settings.scss

  Some rules for the road:

  1. Do !NOT! create a new line/indent the {{#contentFor}} blocks! These settings will most likely NOT WORK if you do so. Please keep the formatting as-is :)
  2. This is only temporary until there is a nicer way (ie. JSON) for Ghost to provide blog-specific vars. The block helper is the only way atm.
  3. Do !NOT! create a non-block-helper block in this file! This file is ONLY for creating content for the block helpers scattered around the other files. If you create a non-block-helper block in this file, whatever it is you created will be on *every* page. Don't do that :)
